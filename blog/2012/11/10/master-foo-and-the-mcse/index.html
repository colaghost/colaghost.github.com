<p><strong>无名师与MCSE能者</strong></p>

<p>一通熟Windows之能者见无名师，曰：“闻师深修Unix之道，吾以密巧相述，相益，可乎？”</p>

<p>无名师曰：“求智，善矣；然Unix之道并无甚密巧。”</p>

<p>能者惑：“人曰师乃当世Unix大道之贤者，通晓其中之变法，如吾之于Windows；吾乃MCSE，有世所罕之证书，吾铭记各注册表项功能于心，更可细述任一Windows API，乃至微软所未曾详述者。师，所以为师，为智，皆揭而知他人之不知也。”</p>

<p>无名师曰：“怠矣，本无秘，何以揭？”</p>

<p>能者嗔：“若无密巧，何以修乃成师之业？”</p>

<p>无名师曰：“求智者，以他人之不知为智，犹如求光明者，拥烛笼火，以为珍贵，乃终被灼也。”</p>

<p>听此，能者顿觉灵光。</p>

<p><strong>Master Foo and the MCSE</strong></p>

<p>Once, a famous Windows system administrator came to Master Foo and asked him for instruction: “I have heard that you are a powerful Unix wizard. Let us trade secrets, that we may both gain thereby.”</p>

<p>Master Foo said: “It is good that you seek wisdom. But in the Way of Unix, there are no secrets.”</p>

<p>The administrator looked puzzled at this. “But it is said that you are a great Unix guru who knows all the innermost mysteries. As do I in Windows; I am an MCSE, and I have many other certifications of knowledge not common in the world. I know even the most obscure registry entries by heart. I can tell you everything about the Windows API, yes, even secrets those of Redmond have half-forgotten. What is the arcane lore that gives you your power?”</p>

<p>Master Foo said: “I have none. Nothing is hidden, nothing is revealed.”</p>

<p>Growing angry, the administrator said “Very well, if you hold no secrets, then tell me: what do I have to know to become as powerful in the Unix way as you?”</p>

<p>Master Foo said: “A man who mistakes secrets for knowledge is like a man who, seeking light, hugs a candle so closely that he smothers it and burns his hand.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing this, the administrator was enlightened.</p>
